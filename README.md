# USD Stable Coins (David) vs Inflation Rate (Goliath)
We aim to promote USD stable coins as a hedge and an alternative investment for non-tech savvy and non-crytocurrency savvy investors to earn and generate reasonably good enough returns to counter the current high inflation environment which is a major concern for common folks. For example, the current inflation rate in the US is around 7.9% p.a. and the return on USD Stable Coin (in CRYTO.COM) can be around 12% p.a.
