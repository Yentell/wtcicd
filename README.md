# USD Stable Coins (David) vs Inflation Rate (Goliath)
We aim to promote USD stable coins as a hedge and an alternative investment for non-tech savvy and non-cryptocurrency savvy investors to earn and generate reasonably good returns to mitigate the adverse effect of the current high inflation environment. The inflation monster is a gigantic concern for many common folks. Many cryptocurrency platforms offer attractive interest rates that are higher than the prevailing inflation rates. For example, the current (Feb 2022) inflation rate in the US is around 7.9% p.a. and the interest rate on USD stable coins in say CRYPTO.COM is upto 12% p.a. (as of 20 Mar 2022).
